Who We Are

We are a non-profit environmental conservation organisation dedicated to protecting and restoring Kenya’s natural ecosystems for current and future generations. Our focus is on empowering local communities, safeguarding biodiversity, and promoting sustainable environmental stewardship. Environmental conservation involves protecting and restoring the natural environment—its air, water, soil, and living organisms—so that ecosystems function properly and continue providing essential services like clean water, fertile soil, and climate regulation.

Our Mission

To conserve, restore, and sustainably manage natural resources through community-led action, education, and partnership with local and global stakeholders.

Why We Exist

The environment supports life, livelihoods, and well-being. Healthy ecosystems provide clean air and water, fertile soils, and habitats for diverse species. Without conservation, habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change threaten biodiversity and human communities alike.

How We Work

We blend field action, education, advocacy, and community engagement to deliver meaningful conservation outcomes. Like many environmental NGOs worldwide, we believe that long-term success depends on involving local people whose lives are intertwined with the land and natural resources we aim to protect.
